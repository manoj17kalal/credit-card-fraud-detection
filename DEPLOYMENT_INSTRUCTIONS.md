## Steps to Deploy to GitHub

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Repository name: `credit-card-fraud-detection`
4. Description: `Real-time Credit Card Fraud Detection System with Streamlit Dashboard and CSV Upload`
5. Set as **Public** repository (for LinkedIn showcase)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/credit-card-fraud-detection.git

# Rename the default branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

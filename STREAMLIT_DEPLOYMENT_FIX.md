# URGENT: Fix Your Streamlit App Deployment

Author: Manoj Kalal

## The Problem

❌ **Your current GitHub Pages deployment shows a text file instead of the working app**

**Why?** GitHub Pages only serves static HTML/CSS/JS files. Streamlit apps need a Python server to run.

## The Solution

✅ **Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud (FREE) instead of GitHub Pages**

## Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub (If Not Done)

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd "d:\job preparation\credit card fraud detection"

# Add remote origin (if not already added)
git remote add origin https://github.com/manoj17kalal/credit-card-fraud-detection.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud

1. **Visit**: [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. **Sign Up**: Click "Continue with GitHub" and use your GitHub account
3. **Authorize**: Allow Streamlit to access your repositories
4. **Create App**: Click "New app"
5. **Fill Details**:
   - Repository: `manoj17kalal/credit-card-fraud-detection`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Main file path: `dashboard/streamlit_app.py`
6. **Deploy**: Click "Deploy!" button

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment

- Deployment takes 2-5 minutes
- You'll see "Your app is in the oven" message
- Once ready, you'll get a live URL like:
  `https://manoj17kalal-credit-card-fraud-detection-dashboardstreamlit-app-abc123.streamlit.app/`

### Step 4: Test Your Live App

✅ Your app should now work properly with:
- Interactive dashboard
- CSV upload functionality
- Real-time fraud detection
- All charts and visualizations

## What You'll Get

🎯 **Working Live Demo**: A fully functional Streamlit app
🔗 **Shareable URL**: Perfect for LinkedIn and portfolio
📱 **Mobile Friendly**: Works on all devices
🔄 **Auto Updates**: Updates when you push code changes
